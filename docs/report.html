<p>Due to a second round of lacking credits on our Azure Database, we
decided to go back to our SQLite Database. Luckily we were already using
sqlite when running the application in developer-mode, so we used that
going forward.</p>
<p>The commit-hash for the latest version of Chirp! with hosted Azure
database is:</p>
<p>ecb9a43f66883a64cd597735826ed7b143cd5b8c</p>
<h2 id="user-activities">User activities</h2>
<p>The Chirp! platform initiates user engagement through a publicly
available timeline, where non-authenticated visitors can read through
user-generated content. This allows for a preliminary understanding of
the platform’s community activities. Interested individuals are then
guided to either log in, if they are returning users, or to register,
should they be new to the community. The registration process is
straightforward, requiring standard user information and adherence to
password protocols.</p>
<p>Upon successful entry into the community, the user experience becomes
personalized. The platform greets users by their chosen names and opens
up a suite of interactive possibilities. Users can contribute their own
content and engage with others through established social mechanisms.
Furthermore, each user has access to a personal dashboard reflecting
their activity and interactions within the community. Lastly, the user
has the opportunity to delete all personal data using the “Forget
me”-button.</p>

<p><img src="images/SEQUENCEnew.png" alt="Sequence diagram" width="400px" /></p>
<p>Once you enter the root endpoint, Public, of our Chirp! application
an HTTP Get Request is sent to our database and returns all of our
cheeps to be displayed. Note that seeing all cheeps is possible for an
unauthorized user whereas liking, following, and cheeping is not. When
trying to log in or register a new account, the user will be redirected
to the respective page. Logging in or registering an account is done by
HTTP Post methods, which either validates the login or registers
(i.e. creating a new author) the new account. In both cases, the user is
redirected to the Public page, now with additional rights.</p>

<h2 id="build-test-release-and-deployment">Build, test, release, and
deployment</h2>
<p><img src="images/GitHubActionsBothWorkflow.drawio.png" alt="GitHub Actions Both Workflow" width="700px" /></p>
<p>The CI/CD pipeline for the Chirp application starts with the
developer committing code to the main branch or creating a pull request.
GitHub Actions are then triggered to execute workflows defined in
build_and_testing.yml and main_bdsagroup6chirprazor.yml (deployment).
This ensures that each commit to the main branch undergoes a thorough
process of integration, testing, and deployment, thereby maintaining the
quality and reliability of the Chirp application with automated
processes for efficiency and consistency.</p>

<h2 id="team-work">Team work</h2>
<p>Show a screenshot of your project board right before hand-in. Briefly
describe which tasks are still unresolved, i.e., which features are
missing from your applications or which functionality is incomplete.</p>
<p><img src="images/Teamwork_diagramnew.drawio.png" alt="Flowchart over issues and project board" width="500px" /></p>
<br>
<p>Upon creating a new issue two synchronous timelines start
simultaneously, one where the issue is being created, a branch made and
the functionality implemented, while the other follow the timeline of
the issue’s lifespan on the project board. A part of both timelines are
iterative, meaning that if our implementation fails or does not live up
to the requirements, we will work continuously until the branch can be
successfully merged into main. Then, and only then, will our issue be
moved to ‘Done’ in our project board.</p>
<p><img src="images/FinalProjectBoard.png" alt="Flowchart over issues and project board" width="900px" /></p>
<p>We’ve cleaned our project board making sure we’ve finished our
ongoing issues. We moved nice-to-have features to the on-hold column
focusing on finishing up higher priority issues based on project
requirements.</p>
<p>Here is a brief description of some of the issues and ideas for
future development.</p>
<h3 id="github-authentication">Github authentication</h3>
<p>We tried repeatedly to solve this issue, but were unable to make it
work. Since we had many high priority issues, and the problem persisted,
we decided to let go of it and rely solely on our own account
system.</p>
<h3 id="edit-personal-info">Edit personal info</h3>
<p>The aim of this feature was for the user to be able to change their
username or associated email. The thought was directed towards giving
the users more control of their accounts.</p>
<h3 id="comments">Comments</h3>
<p>Adding comments to cheeps would aim the application towards a more
socially interactive state, where users would be able to somewhat
communicate directly to eachother. For further development, we believe
that adding this functionality would have a great impact on the user’s
experience. We went as far as implementing a button for this purpose,
but without functionality. The idea was to make a new entity called
Comment, which would hold a reference to a certain cheep and author.</p>
<h3 id="profile-picture">Profile Picture</h3>
<p>We implemented a way to show pictures on the user’s profile, but
never got around to finish it up and allow users to actually upload one.
This feature would add more customization, allowing users to better
express themselves and maybe lay some groundwork for future
image-cheeps.</p>

extensions/plugins installed.</li>
</ul>
<h2 id="how-to-run-test-suite-locally">How to run test suite
locally</h2>
<p>To run the tests, do the following:</p>
<p>Navigate to the root directory and run command: “dotnet test”</p>
<p>Our test-directory consists of a number of XUnit tests. Here we make
sure, that our application is always running, handling data and
executing requests as intended. As an exmample, we made tests for
methods in CheepRepository and AuthorRepository, to make sure that every
time we make changes, it will always be able to handle cheeps and users
correctly. To make sure that our test environment will also be the same
and also making sure it won’t change anything in our current database,
we implemented an in-memory test environment. This will create a
database for us on demand, without having to store it somewhere or look
for existing files. This also insures that we have a fresh database
without using unnecessary storagespace.</p>
<p>Besides our test-directory, we’ve made other kinds of tests. We used
user testing by having other people try out our application and then
used the feedback for further development. A good example would be our
delete cheep button. One of our testers mentioned it would make sense
that you could only delete cheeps from the profile page. We thought that
would make sense and went on to implement that feature. Visual testing
was also part of our process. Running the application and testing new
and existing features by using them and confirming the results.</p>
<h1 id="ethics">Ethics</h1>
<h3 id="asp.net-core-identity">ASP.NET Core Identity</h3>
<p>Using ASP.NET Core Identity for our login and registration
functionality ensures heightened security for users since their
passwords are automatically hashed, making it impossible for cyber
criminals to abuse users’ accounts if they hack into our database
without being able to decrypt the hashed passwords.</p>
<h3 id="anonymity-and-uniqueness">Anonymity and Uniqueness</h3>
<p>Using ASP.NET Core Identity also ensures uniqueness constraints which
creates a more robust set of users since users can not easily be
replicated. In addition to this, by adding the ability to create
username, people can specify their own level of anonymity on the
platform since their emails are not visible between users.</p>
<h3 id="forget-me-functionality">Forget Me Functionality</h3>
<p>In order to be compliant with GDPR which reflects current data
ethics, we have implemented a “Forget Me” feature which ensures that
users at any point in time can delete their accounts along with the
cheeps they have posted. This functionality not only promotes compliance
but also promotes trust between creator and user.</p>
<h3 id="inclusivity-and-accessibility">Inclusivity and
Accessibility</h3>
<p>Pairing the anonymity feature with unrestricted language use we aim
to create a community rooted in principles of free speech and
inclusivity. The introduction of ‘Like’ and ‘Dislike’ functionalities
promotes an environment where free speech is maintained by the community
rather than enforced by the creators.</p>
<br>
<h2 id="license">License</h2>
<p>In our group we decided to opt for the MIT license as it is open
source, allowing others to freely use the software without providing
legal obligations on the software creators thus ensuring that they bear
no legal liability in the case of software malfunctioning, data loss,
etc.</p>
<h2 id="llms-chatgpt-copilot-and-others">LLMs, ChatGPT, CoPilot, and
others</h2>
<p>During the development of Chirp!, we utilized ChatGPT, a Large
Language Model (LLM), as a supportive tool. ChatGPT played a significant
role in our development process, primarily in code generation, debugging
and providing insights into best practices in .NET development. It
served as an on-demand resource for programming suggestions, offering
immediate assistance in clarifying concepts and solving complex coding
challenges. This not only accelerated our development cycle but also
enhanced our understanding of various aspects of .NET. While ChatGPT
proved to be an invaluable asset in streamlining our workflow, we
ensured that all code and architectural decisions were meticulously
reviewed and tested by our team. This approach maintained the integrity
and originality of our project, ensuring that the final product
reflected our team’s skills and dedication to quality.</p>
